"""
This module initializes and defines the public API for the layers package in the Quantum Transformer (QT).
It provides essential components for building quantum transformers, including:

- **InputEmbedding**: Converts input data into a quantum-compatible representation.
- **MultiHeadedAttention**: Implements a quantum-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism.
- **ScaledDotProduct**: Computes attention scores for efficient sequence learning.

These layers form the foundation for embedding and attention mechanisms in quantum transformers.
This API enables users to design and customize their own quantum learning models.

Usage:
To import all available layers:
