"""
This module initializes and defines the public API for the Quantum Transformer (QT) package.
The package contains various classes and functions used for quantum transformers, including
subdirectories: layers and models.

This API provides an interface for designing Quantum Transformers (QTs) by exposing
essential components from these submodules.

Usage:
To import all available layers:
    from qaintum_qt.layers import *

To import specific components:
    from qaintum_qe import QuantumTransformer, QuantumEncoder, QuantumDecoder
"""
