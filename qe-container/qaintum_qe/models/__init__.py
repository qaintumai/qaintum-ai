"""
This module initializes and defines the public API for the models package in the Quantum Transformer (QT).
It includes core components required for constructing and training quantum-enhanced transformer models:

- **QuantumEncoder**: Encodes input data into a quantum-compatible representation.
- **QuantumDecoder**: Decodes quantum-encoded representations back into meaningful output.
- **QuantumFeedForward**: Implements a quantum-enhanced feedforward network for transformation.
- **QuantumTransformer**: The full-stack quantum transformer model integrating encoding, decoding, and attention.

These models provide the foundation for developing quantum-native and hybrid quantum-classical transformer architectures.

Usage:
To import all available models:
    from qaintum_qe.models import *
"""

from .quantum_encoder import QuantumEncoder

__all__ = ["QuantumEncoder"]
